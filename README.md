# Website Template for Project Pages #

This is a simple template for a project webpage. 
For an example see [here](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/ROAM/) 

# Getting Started #

- The main files are the [index.html](index.html) and the [style.css](css/style.css)
- If you like the style you can mostly ignore the second file and mostly edit the index.html
- Do not forget to delete the git related files (also hidden files).
- Delete all dummy data files and replace it with your own content
